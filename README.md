# engineering-education
The Engineering Education Program at Section was created as a medium to provide students a friendly and inviting place to contribute to a real-world projects to help students better build up their professional portfolios and profiles (upon entering the DEV career space). 

Our goal is to allow our EngEd community the opportunity to increase and build upon the skills they have to build the features/enhancements the community wants to see in the EngEd program. At the same time have a place where they can build us a career profile and portfolio that can be leveraged when entering the workforce.

We also offer students the opportunity to write content about related and approved topics (to build up there author profile and portfolio) about Information Technology Web-related services. (Could be something you are learning currently or a write-up on any EngEd Community Contribution they may have contributed). This will serve as a community-generated pool of educational content which is useful for engineers of every level. Published content can be found at [https://www.section.io/engineering-education/](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/).

Our objective is to provide value to students via skill enrichment, portfolio building, and community building. This program helps students get real world experience that they can reference when entering the (DEV) work force. This program is intended to serve as a launchpad for students to jump-start their professional careers. 

### Program Purpose
“Section's Engineering Education (EngEd) Program is dedicated to offering a unique quality community experience for computer science university students. With relevant career building/skill enrichment resources, EngEd is a community for students to share their knowledge with peers around the world, and to help catapult their careers.”

Section partners with university computer science programs across the globe to create a community which is useful for engineers of every (any) level.

EngEd generated content can be found at [https://section.io/engineering-education](https://section.io/engineering-education).

The Section team will monitor and manage any and all contributions to the overall Program.

### Program Resources
- Be sure to sign up to the Section Community Slack Channel at [slack.section.io](https://sectionio-community.slack.com/). Once signed up, join the **#eng-ed** channel for ongoing program communications.

### Help Us Help All
We can only improve and add value by working together with our community. Please help us iterate on our processes so that we can grow this program to enrich the larger engineering community. If you see something that needs attention, please submit an issue so we can address it in a timely manner.

### EngEd Community Contribution Initiative
One of our main goals for the EngEd community is to provide students/contributors a friendly and inviting place to contribute to a real-world projects to help students better build up their professional protfolios and profiles (upon entering the DEV career space). We would like to allow our EngEd community the opportunity to increase and build upon the skills they have to build the features/enhancements the community wants to see in the EngEd program. This Contribution Initiative is strictly restricted to the EngEd community.

To submit an EngEd feature contribution for consideration, be sure to first check [past feature suggestons](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) to ensure relevance and prevent overlap. **Hint**: Use the this EngEd Content Suggestion form to propose article topic for approval and get feedback on topic ideas. [*View content form here*](https://github.com/section-engineering-education/engineering-education/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=enged-feature-suggestion.md&title=Feature+suggestion)
2. When you're ready to submit a suggestion for review, submit your issue with details on what you would like to see added to the EngEd application/program. 
3. Suggestions will be reviewed by the Section team for relevance, and quality. 
4. Once suggested features have been incorporated into our backlog, the Section team will approve your issue and create a pull request to be worked on by the EngEd community.

### EngEd Article Submission Process
We also have an EngEd Article Submission Process that allows our contributors to submit (and publish) a community-generated pool of content which is valuable for engineers of every (any) level.

This is in an effort to provide students a medium to showcase their skills, profiles, and contributed works to any potential employers. 

Students are expected to contribute fully polished and ready to be published (by *fully polished and ready to be published articles* we mean pull request that are submitted in FINAL form draft. Pull requests that require **moderate to major review/revision will either be CLOSED or will not recieve payout upon being published**) articles will be eligible to recieve payouts. 

### Article Submission Instructions
